An abstract base class for Windows synchronization objects.

There is no synopsis. Don't use this module directly. It is used as the basis
for other libraries, such as win32-mutex, etc.

Originally based on the Win32::Ipc Perl module by Gurusamy Sarathy.

This library is a prerequisite for several other IPC related Windows packages.
